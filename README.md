* [D3JS](https://d3js.org)
- Expressive data managed documents
- Smooth integration with React

* [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)
- The De Facto State Management Library for React (over other Flux implementations)

* [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- Middleware fine-grained control
- Async Actions 

* [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
- Easy to use test functionalities
- Not need for DOM (or any other rendering) environment
- Big Adoption and very well supported

* [expect](https://devhints.io/expectjs)
